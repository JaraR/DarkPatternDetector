Group Meeting with Damian (online)
Date and Time: 15:00; 3 October (Thursday)
Agenda: Scope of the project and dataset finding
Discussion Summary:
• Discussed whether the title of the project shoud be changed – no need as Damian agreed that sentiment analysis does technically come under dark patterns.
• For purposes of finding the dataset it is better to search specifically for sentiment analysis or other terms such as linguistic analaysis, eml etc.

• Email the two professionals and ask if they have any datasets for dark patterns,Defence against the dark arts
Phillip R Doyle, and Benjamin
These two professsors are based in UCD so try to invite those in Ireland to a chat for their advice.

• Check google scholars and email them if they have datasets to use
Email many of them as possible – after checking those in Ireland ask others around the world

• EUvsDisinformation group  - another resource/paper Damian mentioned to look at

• Email Data Protection or other groups for more info on datasets

• Damian will contact previous group on LinkedIn – follow up with Damian next re

• Software testing tool is Selenium – If unable to find pre-existing dataset, start generating your own

• Brendan mentioned to create your own dataset by pulling tweets from twitter and labelling them yourself

• Get rid of Dark patterns keep it to Sentiment analysis – only when searching for datasets?

• Check datsets on Cambridge analytica – figure out the ML techniques they used to influence Brexit

• Email first and if none by week 5 then start with generating your own dataset – first check if you can use real world tweets, if not, create synthetic tweets with AI

•Might have multiple datasets try to find for each one – may need to compile datsets to get what we need

Ling is going to talk with Andrea for feedback about UI/UX. 

•Focus on EML - Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory(further links)

•Are the tweets tagged by country or topic? – Ensure the tweets pulled are relevant to your use case

•Maybe create a DB of terms? Of EML, Oppositional, etc – include in Github

•Look at Alex Murphy’s dissertation lit review

•Even 5000-10000 rows is okay, human or machine labelled – better if 60000 minimum

•ICYFAUX project – Misinfo, reliability rating etc
