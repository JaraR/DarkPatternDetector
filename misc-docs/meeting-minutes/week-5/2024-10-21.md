## Discussion Summary
### Meeting with Andrea
- Need to discuss progress on individual dark patterns during presentation
- Need to show visualizations - system diagrams/architecture
- Discuss risks for project/stumbling blocks and what we'll do/what we did in response if they occur as well as any backups in place
- Sprints between now and end of project should be discussed
- Deadline for coding should be set at week 10/11 to give us enough time to write final reports and prepare demo
- What do we expect the final product to look like?
- Demos should be on GitHub for examiners to review
- Be specific and reflective in weekly diaries
- Currently have a roadblock w/ EML, if it persists present what's going on
- Send rough draft to Andrea before Thursday for feedback
- TDD not a requirement, but some sort of testing is; along with user evaluation
- Ensure functional requirements are met; regression test cases can also be looked at
### Team meeting
- Stick to JS, shadcn/ui for majority of UI components and MUI for backup components that are unavailable in shadcn
- Paid Twitter API access expires 28th October
- X/Twitter API pulls tweets from hashtags, and will place into excel sheet
- Finding hateful or racist content on Twitter may be hard to find for the above reason as people may not be tagging that content. Twitter may also decide not to serve that content
- Using BERT for labelling could help with building a dataset
- Try to get rough draft to Andrea by Wednesday at latest
- Refine current functionalities for Friday demo
- Keep references on hand for report
- Fill out report bit-by-bit, can definitely be finished in one day
- Try to get UI branches merged together and working early in the week
### Meeting with Brendan
- Go off and use existing LLMs, no need to build our own
- Experiment on questions to ask LLM
- Check and research LLM models to use
- Vector embedding to input text and return vector string could be an option: https://oralytics.com/2024/08/28/using-openai-to-generate-vector-embeddings/
- Write python code to do something similar above
