## Discussion Summary
- Make sure to note down and add any failed attempts of features or implementations to the report
- Unsure if we need any sort of hosting due to OpenAI API calls being made for EML and no need for data storage
- Website needs some sort of hosting 
    - Do we keep any Dark Patterns we don't finish on the website?
- May ask Andrea about both of the above tomorrow
### ASD
- Frontend and backend (EML) need to be able to talk to each other
- Jiaxin plans on finishing Infinite Scrolling migration, it's about halfway through. 
    - ETA Tuesday or Wednesday
    - May try to implement a screen/scroll freeze after a period of time/scrolling
    - Will try to finish the migration 1<sup>st</sup>
    - Previously wanted to add a counter to detect the number of tweets scrolled past, but there didn't seem to be a solution
- Ling plans on finishing integration of Autoplay to Vite
    - Plans to then re-create/migrate settings page using shadcn
    - If there's enough time, Navbar will be re-created in the same mannner
    - Jara: "Check if it's possible to track the total amount of time spent on autoplay videos"
- Jara is currently unsure of how the current background.js works
    - Deadline for Engagement Notifications is unsure
    - Inspect on Chrome is not currently bringing up anything that would identify an irrelevant notification from a relevant one. Can see each individual notification though
    - May only be able to track the number of popup notifications and not the type of notifications
        - Essentially just the same function of the regular X/Twitter notification bell
    - Jiaxin: "Could try to analyze the notifications to see if there's any info to be had"
### DS
- Discussed new approach to develop backend
	- We may need to use three languages for the backend

- ChatGPT may not be what we need for the backend
	- We may need to look at other alternatives that have more models to use

- Python will interface the API
  - Easy to use without complications and everyone 
  
- We may need to use popup.js
  - This is to call the API

- Trying to have a demonstration for backend on Friday
