# Meeting with Mentor(online)
Date and Time: 14:00, 29<sup>th</sup> October (Tuesday)\
Participants: Jara, Habib, Jiaxin, Ling, Ashus | Abdullah out sick
## Discussion Summary
### Meeting with Andrea
- Interim was very weak compared to the amount of work that we've put into the project
- Update documentation every week with work being done
- Table of contents needs to be added/updated
- Label diagrams and add a table of diagrams
- External examiner will review the paper, doesn't know the work we put in
- Have high granularity in the report, easier to take portions out than put them in after time has passed
- Even if functionality can't be achieved on a particular Dark Pattern, keep it on the website. Make sure to include research, possibilities attempted, what could have been attempted, and future work
- DOCUMENTATION IS PARAMOUNT | Include:
	- info on 1<sup>st</sup> EML attempt
	- include datasets and why they didn't work for EML
	- if detection/functionality could not be achieved on a Dark Pattern, where does tech needs to go to achieve detection?
	- WHY something is working, not just that it's working
- Andrea can review and evaluate front-end funcionalities, this is an expert review. Ask any questions we may have
- Use professors to the fullest - they have a wealth of knowledge
### Team meeting
#### ASD
- JSON passed from OpenAI API to front-end to display
- Ling feels her integration is mostly complete
	- Any research on color choices needs to finalized and added to report
	- Filtering UI for the settings page has been set up but functionality is roughly halfway there
- Jiaxin still working on her integration
- Jara still working on 1<sup>st</sup> attempt at engagement notifs
	- Found that shadcn includes lucide-react, an open-source icon library. May be more accessible than MUI Icons
#### DS
- Research on EML should be on the website

- Explained to mentor no datasets are involved in backend anymore
	- OpenAI model was mentioned to be used for backend

- Document dark pattern research  
	- What worked, didn't work and visualisations should be present
	- A page at least is needed for document 
	- Document should be detailed 

- ChatGPT API code is still in progress
- Jara: "Initial research on Privacy Zuckering & Obstruction seems to indicate that we may need to conduct web crawling. We need to check the Twitter robots.txt file to see what's allowed. If web crawling is possible, the paper 'Dark Patterns at Scale, Findings from a Crawl of 11K Shopping Websites' mentions using a selenium-based web crawler that may be a good starting point."
