# Group Meeting (online)
Date and Time: 20:00, 31<sup>st</sup> October (Thursday)\
Participants: Jara, Habib, Jiaxin, Ling, Ashus

## General
- Discussed how slides and demo would be made for tomorrows meeting
- Discussed current functionality of dark pattern detection for extension
 ### ASD
- Autoplay is fully integrated with Vite base
- Need to check with separate machines to see if functionality is still there
    - Tried to do this on Friday but did not work on Jara's machine
- Infinite Scrolling has not been integrated with Vite base yet
- Jara has rough implementation of engagement notifications that counts # of notifications on X/Twitter and displays that # in results tab
    - Does not seem to be any way to detect irrelevant notifications from relevant ones
    - May try highlighting detected notifications on X/Twitter and integrating with piechart
## DS
- Tried implementing React App but there was a steep learning curve so help was asked from ASD side of the group.
- We have code for the API and are trying to regulate responses
