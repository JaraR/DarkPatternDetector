## What to Improve:

- The EML response UI needs to be more visually appealing, avoiding long sentences or plain paraphrases. _(Ling)_

- Test cases for the obstruction prompt were fewer than expected. _(Habib)_
- Display the count of infinite scrolling events on a pie chart. _(Jiaxin)_
- The carousel that shows the tips for privacy zuckering needs to be dynamic. That would bring in the use of a database 
  and serverside language to our static website. _(Ashus)_
- The EML final report draft is lacking citations and literature review needs to be improved a lot. _(Ashus)_
