## What went well 
- Finished detailed documentation of EML dark pattern research. -Habib 
- All diary entries are up to date for Thursday 6pm submission. - Habib 
- Read and understood how user evaluation report was done for past group. - Habib 
- Nothing major in what went well this week almost everything is a work in progress right now. So can't really say if its going to end well or not. - Ashus
- Have the notification detector up and running again. - Jara
- Improved the infinite scrolling function to make it work across different websites. It now displays the domain name and logo of the 
  current website when the timer starts. - Jiaxin
- Developed an evaluation plan and questions for the infinite scrolling function and its UI. - Jiaxin
-Autoplay detection is functioning well, with updates to the badge icon count when an autoplay is detected. Counts also reflect accurately in the pie chart. - Ling
-Updated icons and color schemes on the pie chart and dark patterns filtering list after research and survey for better visual clarity. - Ling
-Tested autoplay detection on other sites like BlueSky, it works across other sites; - Ling
-Added a customisation component on the settings page for more user control. - Ling
## What to improve 
- Documenting proper step by step process of past user evaluation report to aid with current user evaluation report being made. -Habib
- The diary entries need improvement and more details. - Ashus
- Have some sort of timer between notifications to alert users that they may be getting spammed and inform them where to turn off notifications. - Jara
- For the infinite scrolling timer, the user needs to manually input the time limit. -Jiaxin
- Itâ€™s urgent: The implementation of the notification function and EML must stay on track, as we need to evaluate them as part of the complete product. Currently, only the auto-play detection and infinite scrolling features are functional. -Jiaxin
-Added a switch to toggle detection on/off. It currently requires a page refresh to activate changes. This inconsistency needs fixing. - Ling
-Prof. Andrea provided feedback on the project website, and updates will be made based on these suggestions. -Ling
